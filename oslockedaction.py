            If it is >0, it will just try to remove the lockfile after timeoutDelay seconds and do 'action()' anyway.
            If it is ==0, it will try once and if lockfile exists, it will give up and throw LockFileExists.
        retryPeriod is a float in seconds.
        description will be dumped into the lockfile, so you can see what wrote it.
